    <h1>Happy Birthday, Gurmehar! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
    <div class="heart">ðŸ’–ðŸŒ¸âœ¨</div>
    <div class="message">Happy Birthday my Mehar ðŸ’–

Your first birthday after getting married and youâ€™re glowing in a way that feels so full and real. Watching you step into this new chapter has been such a beautiful feeling. Youâ€™ve always carried strength, grace, and love in you, but now it feels like itâ€™s radiating even more.

Youâ€™ve been my person through so much. My calm when things were messy. My laughter on days that felt too heavy. My reality check and biggest cheerleader. There are very few people in this world who just understand without needing words, and youâ€™re that for me.

I donâ€™t say it enough, but Iâ€™m so grateful for you. For your energy, your loyalty, your softness, your madness. Iâ€™ve always admired how deeply you love and how fiercely you protect the people you care about. Itâ€™s something rare and precious.

This year, I wish you softness in your days, adventure in your heart, and a sense of peace that never leaves. I hope you continue blooming in love, in laughter, in everything that sets your soul on fire. And no matter where life takes us, Iâ€™ll always be hereâ€”cheering for you, holding space, and loving you just the same.

Youâ€™re one of my most precious people and Iâ€™ll never stop being thankful for you.

With all my love,  
Shrishti</div>
